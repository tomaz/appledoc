    @brief      The idea of a symbol is a character that stands on its own, such as an ampersand or a parenthesis.
    @details    <p>The idea of a symbol is a character that stands on its own, such as an ampersand or a parenthesis.</p>
                <p>Multi-character symbols are an exception to the rule that a symbol is a standalone character. For example, a tokenizer may want less-than-or-equals to tokenize as a single token. This class provides a method for establishing which multi-character symbols an object of this class should treat as single symbols. This allows, for example, "cat <= dog" to tokenize as three tokens, rather than splitting the less-than and equals symbols into separate tokens.</p>
                <p>By default, this state recognizes the following multi- character symbols: <tt>!=</tt>, <tt>:-</tt>, <tt><=</tt>, <tt>>=</tt></p>
