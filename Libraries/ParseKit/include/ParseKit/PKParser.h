    @class      PKParser 
    @brief      An Abstract class. A <tt>PKParser</tt> is an object that recognizes the elements of a language.
    @details    <p>Each <tt>PKParser</tt> object is either a <tt>PKTerminal</tt> or a composition of other parsers. The <tt>PKTerminal</tt> class is a subclass of Parser, and is itself a hierarchy of parsers that recognize specific patterns of text. For example, a <tt>PKWord</tt> recognizes any word, and a <tt>PKLiteral</tt> matches a specific string.</p>
                <p>In addition to <tt>PKTerminal</tt>, other subclasses of <tt>PKParser</tt> provide composite parsers, describing sequences, alternations, and repetitions of other parsers. For example, the following <tt>PKParser</tt> objects culminate in a good parser that recognizes a description of good coffee.</p>
@code
    PKAlternation *adjective = [PKAlternation alternation];
    [adjective add:[PKLiteral literalWithString:@"steaming"]];
    [adjective add:[PKLiteral literalWithString:@"hot"]];
    PKSequence *good = [PKSequence sequence];
    [good add:[PKRepetition repetitionWithSubparser:adjective]];
    [good add:[PKLiteral literalWithString:@"coffee"]];
    NSString *s = @"hot hot steaming hot coffee";
    PKAssembly *a = [PKTokenAssembly assemblyWithString:s];
    NSLog([good bestMatchFor:a]);
@endcode
                <p>This prints out:</p>
@code
    [hot, hot, steaming, hot, coffee]
    hot/hot/steaming/hot/coffee^
@endcode
                <p>The parser does not match directly against a string, it matches against a <tt>PKAssembly</tt>. The resulting assembly shows its stack, with four words on it, along with its sequence of tokens, and the index at the end of these. In practice, parsers will do some work on an assembly, based on the text they recognize.</p>
