    @class      PKIntersection
    @brief      A <tt>PKIntersection</tt> matches input that matches all of its subparsers. It is basically a representation of "Logical And".
    @details    The example below would match any token which is both a word and matches the given regular expression pattern. 
                Using a <tt>PKIntersection</tt> in this case would improve performance over using just a <tt>PKPattern</tt> parser as the regular expression would be evaluated fewer times.
 
@code
    PKParser *pattern = [PKPattern patternWithString:@"_.+"];
 
    PKIntersection *wordStartingWithUnderscore = [PKIntersection intersectionWithSubparsers:[PKWord word], pattern, nil];
@endcode
