// Abstract:   This example shows how OpenCL can be used to create a procedural field of 
//             grass on a generated terrain model which is then rendered with OpenGL.  
//             Because OpenGL buffers are shared with OpenCL, the data can remain on the 
//             graphics card, thus eliminating the API overhead of creating and submitting 
//             the vertices from the host.
//
//             All geometry is generated on the compute device, and outputted into
//             a shared OpenGL buffer.  The terrain gets generated only within the 
//             visible arc covering the camera's view frustum to avoid the need for 
//             culling.  A page of grass is computed on the surface of the terrain as
//             bezier patches, and flow noise is applied to the angle of the blades
//             to simulate wind.  Multiple instances of grass are rendered at jittered
//             offsets to add more grass coverage without having to compute new pages.
//             Finally, a physically based sky shader (via OpenGL) is applied to 
//             the background to provide an environment for the grass.
