/** Main application settings provider.
 
 This object implements `GBApplicationStringsProviding` interface and is used by `GBAppledocApplication` to prepare application-wide settings including factory defaults, global and session values. The main purpose of the class is to simplify `GBAppledocApplication` class by decoupling it from the actual settings providing implementation.
 
 To create a new setting use the following check list to update `GBApplicationSettingsProvider`:
 
 1. Create the property here (don't forget about `@synthetize`!).
 2. Set default value in initializer.
 
 If the setting should be mapped to command line switch also do the following in `GBAppledocApplication`:
 
 1. Create a new global string as `static NSString` containing the command line switch name.
 2. Register the switch to `DDCli` (add negated switch if it's a boolean).
 3. Add unit test in `GBApplicationTesting.m` that validates the switch is properly mapped to setting property (note that boolean switches require testing normal and negated variants!).
 4. Add KVC setter and map to corresponding property to make the test pass (again booleans require two setters).
 5. If the switch value uses template placeholders, add unit test in `GBApplicationSettingsProviderTesting.m` that validates the switch is handled.
 6. If previous point was used, add the code to `replaceAllOccurencesOfPlaceholderStringsInSettingsValues` to make the test pass.
 7. Add the switch value printout to `printSettingsAndArguments:`.
 8. Add the switch help printout to `printHelp`.

 The array contains full paths to either directories or files.

Each file is processed the same as any other comment! All non-template files are simply copied over to destination without processing, preserving original directory structure. If the path represents a file, the same logic is applied: if it's a template file it's processed, otherwise it's simply copied over to destination unmodified.
 
 @warning *Note:* All include paths are copied over to destination defined with `outputPath`, inside `docs` directory. If a path represents a directory, it's copied into a subdirectory of `docs` using the last path component name as the subdirectory name. For example: contents of `some/path/to/dir` would be copied to `docs/dir` within `outputPath` and `another/path` would be copied to `docs/path`. In case the path represents a file, it's simply copied inside `docs` directory at `outputPath`.

To better understand how these work together, this is the workflow used when processing parsed objects, prior than passing them to output generators:
 
 1. If `findUndocumentedMembersDocumentation` is `YES`, all undocumented methods and properties documentation is searched for in known super class hierarchy. If documentation is found in any of the super classes, it is copied to inherited member as well. If `findUndocumentedMembersDocumentation` is `NO`, members are left undocumented and are handled that way in next steps.
 2. If `keepUndocumentedMembers` is `NO`, all parsed objects' members are iterated over. Any undocumented method or property is removed from class (of course any documentation copied over from super classes in previous step is considered valid too). If `keepUndocumentedMembers` is `NO`, all members are left and if `warnOnUndocumentedMembers` is `YES`, warnings are logged for all undocumented members.
 3. If `keepUndocumentedObjects` is `NO`, all undocumented classes, categories and protocols that have no documented method or property are also removed. If `keepUndocumentedObjects` is `NO`, all objects are left in the store and are used for output generation and if `warnOnUndocumentedObject` is `YES`, warnings are logged for all undocumented objects.

Also note that this option affects your documentation links - if any link is pointing to category that's going to be merged, it will be considered invalid link, so it's best to decide whther to merge categories of nor in advance and then consistently use properly formatted links.

/** Replaces all occurences of placeholder strings in all related values of the receiver.
 
 This message should be sent once all the values have been set. It is a convenience method that prepares all values that can use placeholder strings. From this point on, the rest of the application can simply use properties to get final values instead of sending `stringByReplacingOccurencesOfPlaceholdersInString:` all the time.
 
 Note that `stringByReplacingOccurencesOfPlaceholdersInString:` is still available for cases where placeholder strings may be used elsewhere (template files for example).

/** Replaces all placeholders occurences in the given string.
 
 This method provides application-wide string placeholders replacement functionality. It replaces all known placeholders with actual values from the receiver. Placeholders are identified by a dollar mark, followed by placeholder name. The following placeholders are supported (note that case is important!):
 
 - `%PROJECT`: Replaced by `projectName` value.
 - `%PROJECTID`: Replaced by `projectIdentifier` value.
 - `%COMPANY`: Replaced by `projectCompany` value.
 - `%COMPANYID`: Replaced by `companyIdentifier` value.
 - `%VERSION`: Replaced by `projectVersion` value.
 - `%VERSIONID`: Replaced by `versionIdentifier` value.
 - `%DOCSETBUNDLEFILENAME`: Replaced by `docsetBundleFilename` value.
 - `%DOCSETATOMFILENAME`: Replaced by `docsetAtomFilename` value.
 - `%DOCSETXMLFILENAME`: Replaced by `docsetXMLFilename` value.
 - `%DOCSETPACKAGEFILENAME`: Replaced by `docsetPackageFilename` value.
 - `%YEAR`: Replaced by current year as four digit string.
 - `%UPDATEDATE`: Replaced by current date in the form of year, month and day with format `YYYY-MM-DD`. For example `2010-11-30`.
 
 @param string The string to replace placeholder occurences in.
 @return Returns new string with all placeholder occurences replaced.
