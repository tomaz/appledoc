/** Provides common methods for tokenizing input source strings.
 
 Main responsibilities of the class are to split the given source string into tokens and provide simple methods for iterating over the tokens stream. It works upon ParseKit framework's `PKTokenizer`. As different parsers require different tokenizers and setups, the class itself doesn't create a tokenizer, but instead requires the client to provide one. Here's an example of simple usage:
 
	NSString *filename = ...
	NSString *input = ...
	PKTokenizer *worker = [PKTokenizer tokenizerWithString:input];
	GBTokenizer *tokenizer = [[GBTokenizer allow] initWithTokenizer:worker filename:filename];
	while (![tokenizer eof]) {
		NSLog(@"%@", [tokenizer currentToken]);
		[tokenizer consume:1];
	}
 
 This example simply iterates over all tokens and prints each one to the log. If you want to parse a block of input with known start and/or end token, you can use one of the block consuming methods instead. Note that you still need to provide the name of the file as this is used for creating `GBSourceInfo` objects for parsed objects!
 
 To make comments parsing simpler, `GBTokenizer` automatically enables comment reporting to the underlying `PKTokenizer`, however to prevent higher level parsers dealing with complexity of comments, any lookahead and consume method doesn't report them. Instead these methods skip all comment tokens, however they do make them accessible through properties, so if the client wants to check whether there's any comment associated with current token, it can simply ask by sending `lastCommentString`. Additionally, the client can also get the value of a comment just before the last one by sending `previousCommentString` - this can be used to get any method section comments which aren't associated with any element. If there is no "stand-alone" comment before the last one, `previousCommentString` returns `nil`. `GBTokenizer` goes even further when dealing with comments - it automatically groups single line comments into a single comment group and removes all prefixes and suffixes.
 
 @warning *Note:* Both comment values are persistent until a new comment is found! At that time, previous comment contains the value of last comment and the new comment is stored as last comment. This allows us parsing through complex code (like `#ifdef` / `#elif` / `#else` blocks etc.) without fear of loosing any comment information. It does require manual resetting of comments whenever the comment is actually attached to an object. Resetting is performed by sending `resetComments` message to the receiver.
